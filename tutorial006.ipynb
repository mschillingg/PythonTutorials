Unless you know magic, you access data from  *data files*, which are files just like a PDF or whatever, but they are specialized to some degree for containing data. Whether from a colleague, a boss, a webpage, or a government data repository, data will come in a data file that you will need to read as input in order visualize and analyze the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "The output case is perhaps less obvious. You read data into your Jupyter Notebook, you make pretty graphs, you do some cool analysis, and then you show it off to some people. You're done, right? But what if you want to share the numerical values of the analysis with someone else? If you can write those values to a data file and just send that, then they can read in the values on their end without having to wade through your notebook and cutting and pasting or whatever.  \n",

Modules are single files that contain useful functions, Packages are directories to a set of modules (or other packages), and Libraries are directories to a set of packages.
